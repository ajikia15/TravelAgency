# What's this about?

A website for a mysterious Travel Agency.
Yes I'm getting payed for this but I still would like the code to be visible to everyone.

# Tools being used:

```
Svelte + Tailwind.
There's no necessity for backend just yet, may consider it later.
```

# Misc

This project was originally started in the Astro framework, but I've realised that there were some
stuff I wouldn't be able to do here. Migrated pretty painlessly.
