# UPDATE: VIEW THE WEBSITE
Temporary hosting for the website - [HERE](https://641975d34182f5771982463e--incomparable-kelpie-891b85.netlify.app) 👈

# What's this about?

A website for a mysterious Travel Agency. 🚩👻
Yes I'm getting payed for this but I still would like the code to be visible to everyone.

# Tools being used:

```
Svelte with Tailwind, some Typescript too.
My goal is to avoid external libraries to make the bundle size smallest possible.
```

# Misc

This project was originally started in the Astro framework, but I've realised that there were some
stuff I wouldn't be able to do here. Migrated pretty painlessly. The website will most likely be live 
by the end of April. Before that, I will host website somewhere temporarily for testing purposes.
